The final keyword does not allow modifying or replacing its original value or definition.

The final keyword can be used in the following three contexts:

- A variable declaration
- A class declaration
- A method declaration

## final variable

If a variable is declared final, it can be assigned a value only once. The value of a final variable cannot be modified once it has been set.

A variable declaration includes the declaration of a local variable, a formal parameter of a method/constructor, an instance variable, and a class variable.

To declare a variable as final, use the final keyword in the variable's declaration.

```java title=Example.java
final int YES  = 1;
```

We can set the value of a final variable only once.

There are two ways to initialize a final variable:

- initialize it at the time of its declaration.
- defer its initialization until a later time.

However, we must initialize the final variable before it is read for the first time.

- final Local Variables You can declare a local variable final. If you declare a local variable as a blank final variable, you must initialize it before using.
- final Parameters We can declare a parameter final. A parameter is initialized automatically with the value of the actual parameter when the method or the constructor is invoked. Therefore, you cannot change the value of a final formal parameter inside the method's or the constructor's body.
- final Instance Variables We can declare an instance variable final and blank final. A blank final instance variable must be initialized once and only once when any of the constructors of the class is invoked.
- final Class Variables We can declare a class variable final and blank final. We must initialize a blank final class variable in one of the static initializers.
- final Reference Variables A reference variable stores the reference of an object. A final reference variable means that once it references an object (or null), it cannot be modified to reference another object.

The following code shows the final formal parameter x for the test2() method:

```java title=Example.java
public void  test2(final int x)  {
```

If we have more than one static initializer for a class, we must initialize all the blank final class variables only once in one of the static initializers.

```java title=Example.java
publicclass Main {
  publicstaticfinal int YES = 1;
  publicstaticfinal int NO = 2;
  publicstaticfinal String MSG;
  static {
    MSG = "final static variable";
  }
}
```

## final class

If a class is declared final, it cannot be extended (or subclassed).

## final method

If a method is declared final, it cannot be redefined (overridden or hidden) in the subclasses of the class that contains the method.
